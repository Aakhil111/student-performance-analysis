# Student Performance Analysis

## Objective
To analyze factors that influence student academic performance using data analysis techniques.

## Dataset
Student Performance Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Key Steps
- Loaded and cleaned raw student data
- Fixed delimiter issues during data ingestion
- Performed feature engineering (average score)
- Visualized relationships between study time and grades

## Key Insights
- Students with higher study time tend to score better
- Absences negatively affect final grades
- Early assessment scores (G1, G2) strongly predict final performance (G3)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how raw educational data can be transformed into meaningful insights using Python-based data analysis.
